This improves upon an {\$}{\$}O(n^2{\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}O(n2logn)-time algorithm by Chang et al. (Proceedings of the 26th ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithm, SIAM, 2015). Weakly simple polygons are required as input for several geometric algorithms. As such, recognizing simple or weakly simple polygons is a fundamental problem.},

@article{ce-upc-17,
	abstract = {Any generic closed curve in the plane can be transformed into a simple closed curve by a finite sequence of local transformations called homotopy moves. We prove that simplifying a planar closed curve with n self-crossings requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Theta (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}}){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the best previous upper bound {\$}{\$}O(n\^{}2){\$}{\$}, which is already implicit in the classical work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}}){\$}{\$}facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any plane graph with treewidth {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega ({$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}to a single vertex, matching known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally, we prove that transforming one immersion of k circles with at most n self-crossings into another requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Theta (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}} + nk + k\^{}2){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case. Finally, we prove that transforming one non-contractible closed curve to another on any orientable surface requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega (n\^{}2){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case; this lower bound is tight if the curve is homotopic to a simple closed curve.},
