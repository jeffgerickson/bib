@article{v-emads-01,
	abstract = {Data sets in large applications are often too massive to fit completely inside the computers internal memory. The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this article we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory (or EM) algorithms and data structures, where the goal is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs. We consider a variety of EM paradigms for solving batched and online problems efficiently in external memory. For the batched problem of sorting and related problems such as permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For sorting, however,  disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O, so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging techniques for using the disks independently. We also consider useful techniques for batched EM problems involving matrices (such as matrix multiplication and transposition), geometric data (such as finding intersections and constructing convex hulls), and graphs (such as list ranking, connected components, topological sorting, and shortest paths). In the online domain, canonical EM applications include dictionary lookup and range searching. The two important classes of indexed data structures are based upon extendible hashing and B-trees. The paradigms of filtering and bootstrapping provide a convenient means in online data structures to make effective use of the data accessed from disk. We also reexamine some of the above EM problems in slightly different settings, such as when the data items are moving, when the data items are variable-length (e.g., text strings), or when the allocated amount of internal memory can change dynamically. Programming tools and environments are available for simplifying the EM programming task. During the course of the survey, we report on some experiments in the domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (transparent parallel I/O programming environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.},

@article{av-icsrp-88,
	abstract = {We provide tight upper and lower bounds, up to a constant factor, for the number of inputs and outputs (I/OS) between internal memory and secondary storage required for five sorting-related problems: sorting, the fast Fourier transform (FFT), permutation networks, permuting, and matrix transposition. The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transferring P blocks each containing B records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to B contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for P = 1 that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for the special case B = P = O(1).},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Hierarchical Memory Model (HMM) of computation. It is intended to model computers with multiple levels in the memory hierarchy. Access to memory location x is assumed to take time ⌈ log x ⌉. Tight lower and upper bounds are given in this model for the time complexity of searching, sorting, matrix multiplication and FFT. Efficient algorithms in this model utilize locality of reference by bringing data into fast memory and using them several times before returning them to slower memory. It is shown that the circuit simulation problem has inherently poor locality of reference. The results are extended to HMM's where memory access time is given by an arbitrary (nondecreasing) function. Tight upper and lower bounds are obtained for HMM's with polynomial memory access time; the algorithms for searching, FFT and matrix multiplication are shown to be optimal for arbitrary memory access time. On-line memory management algorithms for the HMM model are also considered. An algorithm that uses LRU policy at the successive ``levels'' of the memory hierarchy is shown to be optimal.},

Here, we used Shannon's information theory to estimate the amount of encoded information in all the visible matter in the universe. We achieved this by deriving a detailed formula estimating the total number of particles in the observable universe, known as the Eddington number, and by estimating the amount of information stored by each particle about itself. We determined that each particle in the observable universe contains 1.509 bits of information and there are ∼6 × 1080 bits of information stored in all the matter particles of the observable universe.},

@article{s-wh-95,
	abstract = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three‐dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two‐dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two‐dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three‐dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal we give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high‐energy particle collisions are described. The phenomenon of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have long been held by Charles Thorn.},

The bound's correctness is supported by explicit statistical calculations of entropy, gedanken experiments involving the generalized second law, and Bousso's covariant holographic bound. On the other hand, it is not always obvious in a particular example how the system avoids having too many states for given energy, and hence violating the bound. We analyze in detail several purported counterexamples of this type, and exhibit in each case the mechanism behind the bound's efficacy.},

For example, we show (without using diagonalization) that there exist arbitrarily complex functions with optimal RASP programs whose running time cannot be improved by any multiplicative constant. We show, furthermore, that these optimal programs cannot be fixed procedures and determine the difference in computation speed between fixed procedures and self-modifying programs.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses machine models and simulations. The existence of many different machine models does not necessarily mean that there are no uniform underlying notions of computational complexity. In the theory of computation, a large variety of models and formal calculi has been proposed to capture the notion of effective computation. This has not lead to a proliferation of computation theories, because of the basic fact that the proposed formalisms have all been shown to be equivalent in the following sense---each computation in one formalism can be simulated by a computation in the other formalism. From the equivalence, it can be concluded that if a problem is unsolvable in one particular model, then it is also unsolvable for all other formalized computing devices to which this particular model is related by mutual simulation. Consequently the notion of solvability does not really depend on the model used. The basic models of computation themselves remain on the shelf, to be used if and when needed.},
