	abstract = {We introduce a new model of indeterminacy in graphs: instead of specifying all the edges of the graph, the input contains all triples of vertices that form a connected subgraph. In general, different (labelled) graphs may have the same set of connected triples, making unique reconstruction of the original graph from the triples impossible. We identify some families of graphs (including triangle-free graphs) for which all graphs have a different set of connected triples. We also give algorithms that reconstruct a graph from a set of triples, and for testing if this reconstruction is unique. Finally, we study a possible extension of the model in which the subsets of size k that induce a connected graph are given for larger (fixed) values of k.},

@article{ehm-sgb-22,
	abstract = { We study algorithmic problems that belong to the complexity class of the existential theory of the reals (\$\exists \mathbb{R}\$). A problem is \ensuremath\exists \mathbbR-complete if it is as hard as the problem existential theory of the reals (ETR) and if it can be written as an ETR formula. Traditionally, these problems are studied in the real random access machine (RAM), a model of computation that assumes that the storage and comparison of real-valued numbers can be done in constant space and time, with infinite precision. The complexity class \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$ is often called a real RAM analogue of NP, since the problem ETR can be viewed as the real-valued variant of SAT. The real RAM assumption that we can represent and in which we can compare arbitrary irrational values in constant space and time is not very realistic. Yet this assumption is vital, since some \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$-complete problems have an ``exponential bit phenomenon,'' where there exists an input for the problem, such that the witness of the solution requires geometric coordinates which need exponential word size when represented in binary. The problems that exhibit this phenomenon are NP-hard (since ETR is NP-hard) but it is unknown if they lie in NP. NP membership is often showed by using the famous Cook--Levin theorem, which states that the existence of a polynomial-time verification algorithm for the problem witness is equivalent to NP membership. The exponential bit phenomenon prohibits a straightforward application of the Cook--Levin theorem. In this paper we first present a result which we believe to be of independent interest: we prove a real RAM analogue to the Cook--Levin theorem which shows that \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$ membership is equivalent to having a verification algorithm that runs in polynomial-time on a real RAM. This gives an easy proof of \ensuremath\exists \mathbbR-membership, as verification algorithms on a real RAM are much more versatile than ETR formulas. We use this result to construct a framework to study \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$-complete problems under smoothed analysis. We show that for a wide class of \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$-complete problems, its witness can be represented with logarithmic input-precision by using smoothed analysis on its real RAM verification algorithm. This shows in a formal way that the boundary between NP and \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$ (formed by inputs whose solution witness needs high input-precision) consists of contrived input. We apply our framework to well-studied \$\exists \mathbb{R}\$-complete recognition problems which have the exponential bit phenomenon such as the recognition of realizable order types or the Steinitz problem in fixed dimension. Interestingly our techniques also generalize to problems with a natural notion of resource augmentation (geometric packing, the art gallery problem). },

@article{ce-upc-17,
	abstract = {Any generic closed curve in the plane can be transformed into a simple closed curve by a finite sequence of local transformations called homotopy moves. We prove that simplifying a planar closed curve with n self-crossings requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Theta (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}}){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the best previous upper bound {\$}{\$}O(n\^{}2){\$}{\$}, which is already implicit in the classical work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}}){\$}{\$}facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any plane graph with treewidth {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega ({$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}to a single vertex, matching known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally, we prove that transforming one immersion of k circles with at most n self-crossings into another requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Theta (n\^{}{\{}3/2{\}} + nk + k\^{}2){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case. Finally, we prove that transforming one non-contractible closed curve to another on any orientable surface requires {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega (n\^{}2){\$}{\$}homotopy moves in the worst case; this lower bound is tight if the curve is homotopic to a simple closed curve.},
